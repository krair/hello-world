# hello-world

Hello fellow humanoids:

I'd simply like to use this as a way to test out github and eventually push a few of my own projects on here just to keep better track of where they are and what additional features I would like to add.

I am a scuba-diving, sci-fi/fantasy-book-reading and game-playing nerd just looking to make the planet a better place for us to live on.
